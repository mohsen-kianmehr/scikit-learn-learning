# Scikit-Learn Learning

This repository contains my hands-on practice while learning machine learning with scikit-learn.

## Topics Covered
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Classification models
- Model evaluation
- Data preprocessing

## Structure
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for each topic
- `data/` : Datasets used in practice

## Goal
Build a strong foundation in machine learning with scikit-learn and prepare for a complete project.
